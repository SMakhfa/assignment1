    <p class="desc">
      Bora Bora is a small South Pacific island northwest of Tahiti in French
      Polynesia. Surrounded by sand-fringed motus (islets) and a turquoise
      lagoon protected by a coral reef, it’s known for its scuba diving. It's
      also a popular luxury resort destination where some guest bungalows are
      perched over the water on stilts. At the island's center rises Mt.
      Otemanu, a 727m dormant volcano

      Tahiti is the largest island in French Polynesia, the South Pacific
      archipelago. Shaped like a figure-8, it's divided into Tahiti Nui (the
      larger, western section) and Tahiti Iti (the eastern peninsula). With
      black-sand beaches, lagoons, waterfalls and 2 extinct volcanoes, it's a
      popular vacation destination. Explored by Captain James Cook in the 18th
      century, it was also often painted by French artist Paul Gauguin.
